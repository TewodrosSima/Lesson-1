# Lesson-1

What I have leaned today is, about introduction to Android java programming, which is developing Android programs is an exciting experience which will opens up the world of creativity to you and allows you to express yourself in ways you never think about it. In addition to that I have learned as we can think of new ideas for Android apps and it will shows the ways of improving people's lives, for example if somebody likes games, want to create undreamed of new ways to involve users, this is the right place to be. Moreover, I have learned as this course will concentrate on creating Android applications by using the java programming language. Aside from the manifest, XML will be introduced after we become familiar with the Android Java API plus we are using the Android Studio Integrated Development Environment to create Android application.
On the top of that we are encouraged to explore and investigate the options that the Android studio IDE has to offer but one thing we need to do is becoming familiar with the project explorer window, which is the manifest file, the resource folder and the source folder. one of the key features to become accustom to is the makeup of the class file. The MainActivity.java file holds a typical class file. Class files are used to hold related data and functions that work with that data. The most important things to do right now is to become familiar with as many of the features as possible throughout the IDE.
